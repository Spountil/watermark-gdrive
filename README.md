# Watermark App

## Objective

Add a desired watermark at the center of a picture at a desired transparency level. The watermark will only be in white.

## Project Idea

A friend of mine needed to add watermarks to multiple pictures, which required a lot of work to do it manually. Of course, multiple ressources exists online to help with this case, but it was a fun project to work on, and especially learn a little bit about GUI since that person was not used to Python, or any other type of code. 

## How to Run

Just run the interface.py file and voil√†!
